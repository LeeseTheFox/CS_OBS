# CS_OBS
This is a program designed to automatically launch OBS Studio and enable the Replay Buffer feature, serving as an alternative to Nvidia ShadowPlay, but with a whitelist feature.

It was completely written by ChatGPT 3.5. I did not write a single line of code, so judge accordingly.

**Instructions:**
1. Place `CS_OBS.exe` in its own directory;
2. Run `CS_OBS.exe`;
3. The program will generate a `config.txt` file. Open it to adjust settings as needed and add the names of game executables to the end of the file;
4. Save your changes to `config.txt`;
5. Relaunch `CS_OBS.exe`.

Important: CS_OBS needs to be run as an administrator, or it will not be able to hide it's window and close OBS Studio when it should.
